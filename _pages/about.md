I am a Ph.D. Student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC), advised by [Tyler Sorensen](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~tsorensen/) since Spring 2021. My research interests are heterogeneous computing, programming languages, and compiler techniques. 

In particular, I am working on HW/SW co-design for sparse applications, such as accelerating sparse tree applications on heterogeneous systems. Furthermore, I am interested in compiler techniques that automate this process; and also plan to develop novel programming models for sparse data structures as next steps.
